I'm using this repository as a test site for the Hugo Hextra theme.
In particular, I'm trying to track down a problem with the search
function.  See [here](https://github.com/imfing/hextra/issues/714) for more information.

Here's what you'll find on this test site:

* [Posts](/posts/): the test blog
* [Tags](/tags): blog posts grouped by tags
