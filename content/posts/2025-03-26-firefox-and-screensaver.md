title: Make Firefox Disable the Screensaver

After switching back to Firefox for Linux Mint (version 135),
I noticed right away that it doesn't disable the screensaver
when watching videos (e.g., YouTube).  This appears to be
an old problem that was never fixed.  It's a confusing
problem on Mint with the Mate desktop, because there are two parts of the screensaver
settings in Mate:
<!--more-->

* the "normal" settings, where you select all sorts of fancy
screen saver themes
* the Power Management settings, where you force the
display to go into sleep mode after a timeout

In order to make Firefox turn off the screensaver, I first had
to disable the "normal" settings, i.e., uncheck "Activate screensaver
when computer is idle".  I left the Power Management settings alone,
which put the display into sleep mode after five minutes of idle time.

Then I ran [this Python script](https://github.com/dglava/firefox-dpms/blob/master/bin/firefox-dpms)
in a terminal session and left it running.
It would also be possible to set up a shortcut on the desktop to invoke
the script.  To get the script to work on Mint 21, I had to change the first line of the script to
the following:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

The script requires the python `pulsectl` package, which can be installed
using:

    sudo apt install python3-pulsectl

In case the script disappears from Github, here it
is in its entirety.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
